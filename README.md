# Log Plot

** WORK IN PROGRESS **

The basic idea is to parse log files with a pattern of:

<pre>
TIMESTAMP  LOGLEVEL  PID  MESSAGE_WITH_DETAILS
</pre>

In the MESSAGE_WITH_DETAILS is typically a name/label.  In other words, we want to see a scatter plot of periodic errors for a set of names.



TODO:
- Still trying to sort out the details of how to view.
- Want to corrolate plot from RRD database
